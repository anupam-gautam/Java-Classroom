JSP (JavaServer Pages) is a technology used to create dynamic web content in Java. JSP pages contain a mix of HTML, Java code, and JSP-specific elements. Here are the different syntax elements in JSP:

Directive:
A JSP directive is used to give special instructions to the JSP container. The directive starts with the "<%" symbol followed by the directive keyword and ends with the "%>" symbol.
Example:
<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8"
    pageEncoding="UTF-8"%>
    
This directive specifies the page's language, content type, and encoding.

Declarations:
Declarations are used to define variables, methods, and classes that can be used in the JSP page. A declaration starts with the "<%" symbol followed by the "!" symbol and ends with the "%>" symbol.
Example:
<%! int count = 0; %>

This declaration creates an integer variable called "count" with an initial value of 0.

Expressions:
Expressions are used to insert the value of a variable or an expression directly into the HTML content of the JSP page. An expression starts with the "<%" symbol followed by the "=" symbol and ends with the "%>" symbol.
Example:
<p>Current Count: <%= count %></p>

Scriplets:
Scriplets are blocks of Java code that are executed when a JSP page is requested by a user's web browser. Scriplets are enclosed in <% %> tags.

For example:
<%
    String name = "John";
    out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
%>

Comments:
Comments are used to add notes or explanations to your JSP code. There are two types of comments in JSP:

HTML comments: These comments are ignored by the JSP engine and are not sent to the client's browser. They are enclosed in <!-- --> tags, just like regular HTML comments.
For example:
<!-- This is an HTML comment -->
